# Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic Integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations

This is the code for reproducing the experiments from [Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic Integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations]().

The plots can be reproduced with the notebooks in `notebooks/paper` and the [data]([https://zenodo.org/records/](https://zenodo.org/records/10679920)) or alternatively by running the experiments which are found in `scripts/experiments`.

To run the experiments you need to install julia version 1.9.4. Then from within the repository run the `julia` REPL. The packages can be installed using `] activate .` followed by `instantiate`.
